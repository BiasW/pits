PITS - Tracker software for the PITS board, for use in High Altitude Ballooning.

Created by Dave Akerman (dave@daveakerman.com)

This software is written for the Raspberry Pi model A or B,
with the Pi In The Sky (PITS) board from http://ava.upuaut.net/store/.

It has now been modified to work on the B+ board, with the PITS+ board.

Software support is provided for customers who have
purchased a PITS or PITS+ board, for use with that board only.
