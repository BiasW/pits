PITS - Tracker software for the PITS board, for use in High Altitude Ballooning.

Created by Dave Akerman (dave@daveakerman.com)

This software is written for the Raspberry Pi model A or B,
with the Pi In The Sky (PITS) board from http://ava.upuaut.net/store/.

It has now been modified to work on the B+ board, with the PITS+ board.

Software support is provided for customers who have
purchased a PITS or PITS+ board, for use with that board only.

INSTALLING

CHANGE LOG

19/12/2014

- GPS code completely re-written to use WiringPi library instead of bcm library
- default configuration now leaves the monitor on, to ease development
- As the PITS+ boards are set by frequency in MHz, but the earlier board was
  set by channel number, the code now accepts either "frequency=nn" for channel
  number, of frequency=xxx.xxxMHz for actual frequency.  Not that using the
  second form does not give you more options on the older board - the frequency
  will be set to the closest channnel.
- Camera filenames are now the system time
- Camera images are now saved in dated folders

01/06/2015

- MTX2 frequency-setting code changed to fix random fails to set frequency
- logging now on by default
- log files removed from repository
- Long payload IDs are truncated to 6 before passing to SSDV program
- SSDV image widths and heights now forced to be multiples of 16 pixels
- Added support for second (external) DS18B20 temperature sensor
- Fix to occassional missing packets
- Support for Pi V2 B
- Protect against BMP085/180 being disconnected after initialisation
